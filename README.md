Newspaper is a Python module used for extracting and parsing news articles. To extract information from the websites of newspapers and magazines we are going to use Newspaper library.
Using Newspaper library, not only extracting and curating articles, but you can also extract text, summary text, get text keyword.


## Getting Started:
**1. Download [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/install-packages/).**
* I downloaded Individual Edition. Anaconda is the world's most popular Python distribution platform which contains Python packages including Jupyter Notebook, Scipy, Numpy, Panda, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, etc. 
**2. Launch a Jupyter Notebook. You need to launch a Jupyter notebook to write and iterate your Python code. See [Instruction](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/how-to-use-jupyter-notebooks/).**

**3. Installation Newspaper Module in your Jupyter notebook terminal**
```
pip install newspaper3k
